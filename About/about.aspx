        Welcome to the website of Team 375: The Robotic Plague. We go to Staten Island Technical
        High School, in Staten Island, New York. We're a rather small team with only some 20-odd members.
        We are a veteran FIRST Robotics Competition team, and have been actively participating since 2000. But: what is FIRST Robotics?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        FIRST Robotics is a worldwide competition involving an ever-changing game. Annually, many teams from around the world gather together
        to witness the new game for the year. Every year each team must build their own robot to compete in the year's unique game. 
        However, the fun doesn't stop there, as there are other equally important tasks that must be completed to compete. 
        One rather important one is the programming of the robot. Other aspects of the competition are an animation and the website you're viewing 
        now. Every year, around the middle of Febuary, each teams project is submittes to the judges at FIRST, and every year our team competes in
        different locations ready to compete against hundreds of other robots, which are each designed by a different method to
        accomplish the same mission. This is the beauty of FIRST and engineering in itself: seeing how others accomplish the
        same task, but in a different manner than you would.
