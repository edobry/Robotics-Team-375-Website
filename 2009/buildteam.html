<div id="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Team 375, the build team is the
biggest sub-team. For 42 days we work
non-stop on building a functional, and hopefully, stable robot. They
work down in the lab and typically stay at school the latest out of all
the subteams, at least until 7:45 during build season. This is after a
long, hard day at school, which is exhausting, tiring, and extremely
difficult, but definitely worth it in the end. The excitement of
competing in <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.usfirst.org/" target="_blank">FIRST</a> makes it worth it right there, but the knowledge,
experience, and memories the team builds along the way are worth <span style="font-style: italic;">so</span> much more. William Tsimerman is currently captain, and Mr. Seigel is the head mentor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This year's game, "<a href="yearsgame.html">Lunacy</a>", presents a brand new challenge to the build
team. Instead of using our own custom modified wheels, we must use
special wheels designed to not have much traction. This adds to the
lunacy of <a href="yearsgame.html">Lunacy</a>. We test many different ways and strategies to make
the most out of these wheels as to have the biggest advantage over
other teams, and are looking forward to seeing what they do to overcome
this obstacle also.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the work going on down in the lab between strategising, building,
welding, cutting, etc., it is extremely important to stress safety and
organization. Occasionally we get a little out of order, but the
mentors always remind us all the next day. Fortunately, we have not
have had anything more than very minor injuries happen in the shop in
years.
