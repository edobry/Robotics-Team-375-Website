<div id="content">This years game for the <a style="font-style: italic;" target="_blank" href="http://www.usfirst.org">FIRST</a> Robotics competition is known as Lunacy.<br><br><h2><span class="mw-headline">Game overview</span></h2><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">The game is played on a field known as the "Crater", which is a 54-foot by 27-foot <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(16 × 8 m)</span> carpeted rectangular field. The majority of the Crater is covered by a 50-ft by 24-ft <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(15 × 7 m)</span><br>low-friction surface known as "Regolith".<br>Two alliances, one red and one blue, composed of three FIRST
Robotics Competition teams each, compete in each match. The object of
the game is to attain a higher score than your opponent by placing the
game pieces in the trailers hitched to the opposing alliance's robot.
<p>The game is made up of two scoring periods. The first 15 seconds of
play is the Autonomous period, in which robots operate according to
pre-programmed instructions. The next two minutes of play is the
Teleoperated period. At this time, robots are radio-controlled by team
operators standing at either end of the field.</p>
<p>While playing Lunacy, robots manipulate game pieces &#8212; 9-inch
diameter round objects, made of 1-inch wide strips of fabric-covered
polymer. There are three types of game pieces, "Moon Rocks", "Empty
Cells", and "Super Cells". Only "Moon Rocks" and "Empty Cells" are
available to the human player. To obtain a "Super Cell", a robot needs
to transport an "Empty Cell" from the outpost to the fueling station.
The "Super Cell" cannot be used until the last 20&nbsp;seconds of the game.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection"></span>&nbsp;<span class="mw-headline">Scoring</span></h3><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<ul><li>Moon Rocks (Orange and Purple) &#8212; 120 available &#8212; 2 pts</li><li>Empty Cells (Orange and Blue) &#8212; Up to 8 &#8212; 2 pts</li><li>Super Cells (Green and Purple) &#8212; Up to 8 &#8212; 15 pts</li></ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3><span class="editsection"></span>&nbsp;<span class="mw-headline">Autonomous period</span></h3>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>The autonomous period is the 15-second period at the start of a
match. Pilot control of the robot is not permitted at this time. During
this period, the robots may react only to sensor inputs and commands
programmed into the onboard control system. All robot safety rules are
still applicable during the autonomous period. The autonomous period
ends when the arena timer displays zero seconds left in the period.</p><br><br>
