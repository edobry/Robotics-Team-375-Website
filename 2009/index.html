illustrious Team 375: The Robotic Plauge. We
are located at&nbsp;Staten Island Technical High School and are a rather
small team with only 23 members. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You may be
wondering what
sport has team numbers instead of names. Our sport has thousands of
teams all over the
world and our website is only one out of the thousands that is annually
submitted for the <a href="http://www.usfirst.org"><span style="font-style: italic;">FIRST</span></a> Robotics competition. But what is&nbsp;<a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.usfirst.org">FIRST</a> Robotics?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.usfirst.org"><span style="font-style: italic;">FIRST</span></a>
Robotics is a competition involving an ever
changing game.
Annually, every team from the world gathers together to witness the new
game for the year. This year's game is known as Lunacy and more
can be found out about it at the <a href="team.html">Team Section</a> or at the
<a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.usfirst.org">FIRST</a> website, <a href="http://www.usfirst.org">www.usfirst.org</a>.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're already rooting for us to win,
thank you, but we would like you to
know that the actual members of the team won't be playing.
Instead every year each team must build their own robot to compete in
the year's unique game. This robot must be created by each
participating team. However, the fun doesn't stop there, as there are
other equally important tasks that must be completed to compete. One
rather important one is the
programming of the robot. An animation and the [rather beautiful]
website
you're viewing now are two other things that may be made for the
competition. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every
year,
around the middle of Febuary, each different team's project are
given to the judges at <a href="http://www.usfirist.org"><span style="font-style: italic;">FIRST</span></a>, and every year our team strives to
meet with our
robot in a different location ready to compete against hundreds of
other
different robots which are each designed by a different method to
accomplish the same mission. This is the beauty of <a href="http://www.usfirist.org"><span style="font-style: italic;">FIRST</span></a> and
engineering in itself; seeing how others accomplish the same task, but
in a different manner than you would.<br><br><br><br>
