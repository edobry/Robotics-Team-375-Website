<strong>Importance of Safety Goggles</strong><br />
This animation illustrates our first sucessful attempts at character animation.  Although it is humerous, it does explain that safety gogglles are important in securing your eyes from dangerous airborn particles..<br /><br />

<h1>2007 Animations</h1>

<strong>You Be the Hero</strong><br />
This year's AVA entry.  Based on the theme "Think Green", the animation shows that you don't have to be a superhero to do the little things to save the environment.  Plagued by technical problems and lost computers, it seemed as if the animation was not going to be completed this year.  Because the animation came right to the wire, the errors in the animation that would have been normally fixed could not be and the animation had to be submitted as is.<br /><br />

<strong>Phillip for FIRST</strong><br />
Possibly the best animation to emerge from Team 375's animation team.  Although relatively simple, the animation is cute and relays its message of safety effectively.<br /><br />
