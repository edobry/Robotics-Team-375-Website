<h2>Mentoring</h2>
<p><strong>Lego Mentoring</strong></p>
<p>Team 375 is heavily involved in New York's FIRST Lego League.  We mentor 24 out of the 28 lego robotics teams on Staten Island.  This year we had the pleasure of having one of the teams that we mentor win the directors award at the New York City competition.  We look forward to seeing them compete at nationals.</p>

<p><strong>Vex Mentoring</strong></p>
<p>Team 375 also entered the world of Vex in 2005 by mentoring the Farrel High Scool's FIRST Vex Robotics Team.</p>

<p><strong>FRC Mentoring</strong></p>
<p>As well as entering the competition ourselves, our team also mentors many other FIRST Robotics Teams.  These teams include teams 1396 and 1676.</p>
