<h2>FIRST</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="images/logos/verizon.jpg" align="left" class="marbor" /> 
Originally the Bell Atlantic Company, the Verizon Foundation has been with us since the very beginnings of the team.  Through the support and good will of Verizon, we were able to create our first robot and attend our first regional in Long Island.  By providing monetary support to many FIRST Robotics Teams, Verizon has shown immense support for the FIRST Robotics Organization and unyielding faith in its message.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Team 375's first team motto was "There's a Plague on the Horizon, and they're sponsored by Verizon"
