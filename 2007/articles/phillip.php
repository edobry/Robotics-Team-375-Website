<h2>The Making of "Phillip for First"</h2>
<h1>by Michael Iannelli</h1><br />

<p><strong>The Idea</strong><br />
The idea for Phillip had first emerged about one week after the rules for the 2007 Safety Animation were sent.  I was sitting at a table in the corner of the robotics lab, playing with pencil and paper, trying to think of ideas for what to animate.   <img alt="" src="articles/phillip/draw.jpg" class="marbor" align="left" />The moment of truth came when I put a pair of eyes on a first aid kit that I had drawn,.  The eyes were then followed by a mouth, and a creative name, Phillip.  After proposing this concept to the rest of the team of a talking First Aid Kit, everyone thought that I had finally lost it.  However, Mr. Siegel said that it was an adorable idea and that I should go for it.<p>
<br clear="all" />
<p><strong>Planning</strong><br />
<img alt="" src="articles/phillip/title.jpg" class="marbor" align="right" />I gathered the animation team together to discuss what we would show in the animation.  We settled on four main safety practices: Keeping a clean and organized work area, a fire extinguisher nearby, safety goggles gloves ready when needed, and a First Aid Kit nearby.  The safety features would all be shown around a room, in order to emphasize being “surrounded by safety”.  A diagram of the room was built and the placement of each of safety related objects was decided.</p>

<p>The next step was to create a script for Phillip, which, ironically, happened to be the toughest part of the animation.  If the animation was to have an introduction, conclusion, and include each of the four safety practices, it needed to be organized and concise.  Phillip starts by introducing himself to the audience and informing everyone that a robotics lab can be very dangerous and that the proper safety precautions should always be taken.  He then flies around the room pointing out safety methods to the audience.  He makes a quick joke at Bill’s spot on the wall and then finally concludes by reminding the audience to keep themselves “surrounded by safety” at all times.</p>

<p>The idea was to keep the animation simple and humorous while at the same time seriously portraying the safety hazards of a work area and how to keep it safe.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>The Creation Process</strong><br />
For the voice of Phillip, someone with a clear voice was needed.  <img alt="" src="articles/phillip/wire.jpg" class="marbor" align="right" />Our usual narrator had graduated the previous year; so, auditions were held among team members to see who could best act out the voice.  After trying out almost a dozen people, we settled on the voice of one of the new members of the team.  His voice was recorded.  The pitch was raised slightly, and the recording underwent several noise reduction filters.</p>

<p>While modeling the lab and its objects, I had to keep one very important concept in mind, “Think Cute.” I had to avoid reality in the fixtures and objects in the animation.  The machines, furniture, tools, etc. were all created out of proportion and sharp lines were eliminated in as many places as possible.  Everything was given a very bright material and texture.</p>

<p>As the centerpiece of the animation, an incredibly cute character had to be created.  Phillip’s body is essentially a rounded box with a rounded cross on his face.  His eyes are colored cylinders.  The glossy effect was established by placing a clear, shelled sphere over the eyes.  This gave the eyes the appearance of being shiny and round.  For Phillip’s mouth, a distorted box was used.  When Phillip spoke the mouth would be scaled in different directions.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="articles/phillip/work.jpg" class="marbor" align="left" />Animating the lab was relatively simple.  In the scene with the clean work area, the tools and supplies were moved out of place over the course of several frames.  This displayed the objects becoming messy.  The key frames were then reverse in order to show a messy work area becoming clean.  The fire extinguisher came next.  It’s spray was achieved using particle effects.  The safety goggles were spun around on the cabinet while a drawer of the cabinet opened up, revealing a glove that later waved to the audience.  Phillip then flew to another First Aid Kit hanging on the wall.  Animating Bill was essentially the same as Phillip.  He begins with his eyes closed to show that he is sleeping.  He then opens them to answer Phillip’s question.<img alt="" src="articles/phillip/goggles.jpg" class="marbor" align="right" /></p>

<p>Rendering posed a serious problem.  On school computers, the entire process took a total of nine hours.  This meant that the animation would have to be left to render overnight every time a render was attempted.  If I was to have wrought time for tweaks and re-renders, I would have to find a quicker way.  I took the animation home, where the rendering would take two hours total.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Post Production</strong><br />
I then showed the animation to the team mentors.  They had some suggestions for improvements.  Slight tweaks here and there, put a still screen in the end, give the goggles a slightly darker color, etc.  The animation was re-rendered three times before the final one was accepted.</p>

<p>The final rendering was then combined with a title plate and a credits screen and put into a video editor.  It was then burned onto a DVD and sent to FIRST.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Final Words</strong><br />
I had originally intended to put sound effects in the animation; however, they interfered with Phillip’s voice at times.  Since this was the safety animation, and a narration is important in a safety animation, the sound effects were scrapped and only a narration was used.</p>
