<h2>Subteams</h2>
<p>The subteams of The Robotic Plague consist of:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Build Team</strong> - Making sure the robot gets built and stays together through all the beatings it has to take.</li>
<li><strong>The Programming Team</strong> - We can't just have the robot sitting around doing nothing all day, can we?</li>
<li><strong>The Animation Team</strong> - Situated in animation land (aka the CIM room), the animation team creates all of those amazing displays you see.</li>
<li><strong>The Website Team</strong> - Partnered with the animation team, the website group is hard at work making what you're looking at right now.</li>
<li><strong>The Artistic Team</strong> - Someone's gotta make us look good, and those fields have to get built.</li>
</ul>
