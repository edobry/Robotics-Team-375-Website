<h2>Season 2005</h2>
<img alt="" src="media/pictures/2005/ny/9.jpg" height="213px" width="320px" align="left" class="marbor" /> <p>The 2005 season was truly an excellent year for our robotics team.  The team again sucessfully hosted the Staten Island Lego League Tournament.  In the competition season, Team 375 won the regional champion's award in both New Jersey and New York, a feat never accomplished before.  The year also marked the first year that an Autodesk Visualization Award team was founded.</p><br clear="all" />
<p><strong>The Robot:</strong> Rocky<br />
Rocky was one of 375's strongest and sturdiest robots.  It contains a 60 pound chassi designed to travel quickly on two wheel drive.  It rather sophisticated arm was designed for retrieving and scoring up to two tetras at once.  It's piston driven arm contained a locking mechanism that prevented the tetras from escaping while our team tried to score and a winch and pully in order to increase the size of the arm and score wven with othe rrobots in the way.</p>
